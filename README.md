# TotalErrorAPI
API University Course Project

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the application is working, a certain *OneDrive* directory added to the file system of our PC will be accessed. Every day new CSV files will be added which will be named after the date of their upload in *OneDrive*. The API reads only the new added files and not those which are already read (using *Csv Helper* library). The app checks every day at the same time (using the *Quartz* library) if there is a new file and if it is, then reads it and saves it to the database. The date of the file is saved in a column only in *Orders* and *Sales* tables and the date of saving a record is stored in all tables in the database. If country or region is not present in the database, its recored gets added to it in the relevant table. The app has routes that execute the main CRUD and grouping operations (grouping by country, region, date of order; also is accessible the total expenses and/or income depending on the chosen criteria). The API returns the data in JSON format. The app requires user's authentication through Token Authentication. It is using JWT for that purpose. The app also uses *Automapper* to map the DTOs to models and *Swagger* for describing the API.
